# dbt

dbt-trino project `marketplace` over `lake.silver`, writing every model to `lake.gold` (Trino on
Lakekeeper). Run it from the repo root: `make dbt-parse` (no warehouse), `make dbt-build` (seed,
run, test; needs `make start`).

- `models/staging`: `stg_<table>` views over the seven silver tables. Columns renamed, no filter:
  deleted rows stay with `is_deleted`, and each consumer decides (D4 of
  `docs/planning/07-w3-spec.md`). `updated_at` is when silver merged the row, not a business time.
- `models/intermediate`: `int_orders_enriched` (order, customer, live item and payment
  aggregates).
- `models/marts`: `fct_orders`, `fct_order_items` (deleted items included), `dim_customers`
  (grain `customer_unique_id`, D3), `dim_products`, `dim_sellers`.
- `seeds/category_translation.csv`: Portuguese category to English, 71 rows. Geolocation is not
  modelled (D5).
- `macros/trino__reset_csv_table.sql`: a seed reload truncates the table instead of dropping it
  (D14).
- `tests/generic/unique_combination.sql`: uniqueness of a composite key, without packages.
- `profiles.yml`: target `dev` (Trino at `TRINO_HOST`:`TRINO_PORT`, default 127.0.0.1:8080) and
  `ci` (parse only). No secrets: Trino has no authentication and listens on 127.0.0.1.

Every table model is `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE` (`on_table_exists: replace`, D6): the rename
default would drop a backup table on every run, and on Lakekeeper a drop keeps the files for 7
days.

SQL is linted from this directory: `cd dbt && uv run sqlfluff lint models macros tests`.
